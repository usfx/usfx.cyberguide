                <p>Cyber criminals can use your personal email to access your personal information and accounts which can result in identity theft. They can also find out important personal information such as your bank details, your address and date of birth.</p>
        
        <p>Having a different strong password for your email means if cyber criminals try to steal one of your other accounts they won't be able to access your personal email.</p>
        
        <h2> How can you create a strong password?</h2>
        
        <p>Using three random words to create a strong password. A great way to create a memorable and strong passoword is to use three randon words. Symbols and numbers can still be used if needed, for example 4bluehousedog28!</p>
        
        <p>Try to be creative and use words or numbers that are memorable to you, so that no one can guess your password. Social media accounts can give away alot of vital clues about yourself so AVOID using family names or your favourite sports team which can be easy for people to guess.</p>
        
        <h2>Avoid using the following personal details for your personal password:</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Parent's name</li>
                <li>Child's name</li>
                <li>Other family members name</li>
                <li>Pet's name</li>
                <li>Place of birth</li>
                <li>Something related to your favourite sports team</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>One of the most import security tips is turning on Two Factor authentication on your personal email.</h2>
        
                <figure>
                <img src="images/twofactor.png" alt=" " />

                </figure>
        
        <h2>What is Two Factor autentication (2FA)?</h2>
        <p>It's a way of double checking if you are the person who you are claiming to be when you use any online service such as Email, Bank or any Social media.</p>
        
        
        <p>It makes sure your data is secured and it is a great way to improve the secuity of your personal accounts. Even if you have a good password it can be stolen from service provider/your phone/laptop or tablet you can also be tricked into reveling them. This is why people need to use 2FA. By setting up the use of 2FA it will require extra check so even if the criminal get your personal password he won't be able to access your account. By setting up 2FA, the server will ask the user to provide second factor which is something only you (The User) can do or access. It can be a code or a text so, you should use 2FA plus it doesn't take that much to set it up.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Two-factor authentication:</h2>
        <p>Text messages: Which is used by most of the services online it tend to offer 2FA over text messages by default because during any setup you are required to provide your phone number, and the service will either send you a text or for the code or use voice message which ever option you like.</p>
        <p>Backup codes: When you switch on 2FA they give you back up codes and when asked for it you can use one of them but the codes will only work once. It can be really useful if you don't have your phone in your hand but it needs to be stored in a safe place.</p>
        <p>Authenticator Apps: It is also one of the great ways for security it can also be an alternative to text messages. When you install it you can use the app to set up 2FA on any of your personal accounts that has it as an option. Those apps offer great advantages over texts which won't need any mobile signals or waiting for any texts to arrive.</p>
        
        
            
        <p>The NCSC strongly recommends that you set up 2FA on your personal important accounts, accounts that are really important and can cause the most harm to you if the password was stolen.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>How do you set Two-factor authentication?</h2>
        <p>Well alot of services online already use 2FA and have it switched on. However some don't which means you will need to switch it on by yourself to give your important account better protection. Switiching on 2FA is found in security setting of your account which can also be called (two-step verification).</p>

        <p>Here is also a great website which is recommended by the NCSC : <a href="www.turnon2fa.com/tutorials"> 2FA Tutorials.</a> which contains instructions on how to set up 2FA in Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and alot of other popular online services.  </p>
        
        
        <h2>Password Managers and what are their benefits?</h2>
        <p> What is a password manger? it's a app on your phone, laptop or tablet that stores and keeps your personal data safe so you (TheUser) don't need to memorize it. You can also dawnload certain apps that can create random passwords.</p>
        <p>Why do i need a password manger? We all know that using the same password on different accounts can be really dangerous because a cyber criminal can steal one of your personal passwords which means they will be able to break into other accounts despite knowing one password. So we have to create a hard password for our account, which can be done by password managers.</p>
        <p>Where can i get password manger? You might be using password manger without knowing which is already build in your browser such as Firefox and Google chrome. There is also apps that are available to dawnload which can be installed on any type of devices.</p>
        
        <h2> How can i protect my password manager?</h2>
        <p>It is really important to protect your password manger because if any cyber criminal access it, they potentially have acess to all your personal passwords. Plus you have to make sure you can get in yourself so you don't lose your personal passwords.</p>
        
        <p>NCSC strongly recommends the user to:</p>
        
        <ul>
                <li>Use Two Factor authentication</li>
                <li>Install the latest pdates for the application</li>
                <li>Use strong password</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If you are using built in password manger you might be be protected already by your account such as google chrome browser which is protected by Google and Apple Keychain which is protected by your AppleID </p>
        
        <h2>Lastely How am i suppose to protect my perosnal device?</h2>
        <p>Screen lock is really important for your device because it offers an important layer of security, Such as PIM and Password or Finger print. Which means if any one gets hold of your personal device he won't be able to access any data.</p>
        <h3>Avoid using Easy Pins such as 1,2,3,4 or any L shapped pins because it can be easily guessed.</h3>
